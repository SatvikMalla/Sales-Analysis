# Sales Analysis

This repository contains my analysis of a pizza sales dataset. The analysis includes SQL queries to explore sales KPIs, trends, and various insights. I also performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations using both SQL and Excel, resulting in a dynamic dashboard.

## Project Structure:
- **SQL/**: Contains the SQL scripts used to analyze and verify the pizza sales dataset. Key focus areas include trends analysis, KPIs verification, and sales metrics across pizza categories, sizes, and periods.
- **CSVs/**: Contains the original pizza sales dataset in CSV format. Includes cleaned and formatted Excel versions of the dataset and analysis results, which were used for visualization in Excel.
- **Dashboard/**: Contains the Excel workbook (.xlsx) where the pivot charts and dynamic dashboard were created based on the sales analysis. Includes a screenshot of the dashboard summarizing key insights, trends, and KPIs from the pizza sales dataset
